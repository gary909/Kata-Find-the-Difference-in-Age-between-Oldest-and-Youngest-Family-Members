    <title>Find the Difference in Age between Oldest and Youngest Family Members</title>
    <script src="app.js"></script>

    <p>
        At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.
        <br>
        You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array (a tuple in Python) with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].
